> Vulkan API ray tracing cross-platform layer 

## Critical news!
We have no good debug application base for Vulkan API. Any search in Github don't gave any good results. Project have risk to be frozen up to 1 year. We currently have an acute shortage of time to find solutions, and especially the development of our own. I now have very bad health to write a new platform for debugging. 

## Repositories
- https://github.com/world8th/vRt (GitHub, owned by Microsoft)
- https://gitlab.com/world8th/vRt (GitLab, merging)

## Planned

### June 2018 ("Lava Rains")
- Write rendering part (for debugging and experimenting)
- ~~Write shaders part (stabilize next-gen ray-tracing shaders)~~ Done!
- ~~Write first Vulkan API 1.1 ray tracing interface~~ Done! 
- ~~Write first implementation~~ Done! 

### July 2018 ("Early Vulkanism"), hope
- Improve API and interfaces
- Development of implementation 
- Debugging and experimenting stage 
- Support for NVidia (GTX 9, 10, Titan series) and AMD (RX Vega) hardware

### August 2018 ("First Life"), hope
- Coming to alpha stage
- Finish to fix common bugs and issues 
- First implementations in bigger framework and engines (The Forge, Unreal Engine 5, Blender 2.90)
- Write real-time application with ray tracing 

### Beyond... 
- Make custom GLSL/HLSL compiler for unified compatibility 
- Coming to beta stage
- Compatibility with Nvidia RTX, PowerVR Wizard Ray Tracing, Intel Larrabee 2019
- Compatibility with mobile platform 
- Compatibility with Apple OS
